\title{Create Cutoff Intervals for Time Differences}
\usage{
create_cutoffs(cutoff = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cutoff}{A numeric vector specifying the cutoff values for the intervals. If not provided, it defaults to \code{Inf}.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
\item{cutoff}{A numeric vector of the cutoff values including \code{-Inf} and \code{Inf} if not already present.}
\item{labels}{A character vector of the labels for the intervals, starting from "T0".}
}
\description{
This function generates cutoff intervals and corresponding labels for categorizing time differences.
The labels start from "T0" and continue as "T1", "T2", etc. The intervals are specified by the \code{cutoff} parameter.
The function ensures that intervals are properly labeled and that \code{-Inf} is used as the lower bound and \code{Inf} as the upper bound if not already included in the cutoff values.
